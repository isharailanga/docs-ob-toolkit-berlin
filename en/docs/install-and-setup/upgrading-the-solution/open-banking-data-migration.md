!!! tip "Before you begin:"
    Back up all the databases before performing the migration.

1. To create the required database tables:
    - Run the relevant SQL script in the `<IS_HOME>/dbscripts/open-banking/consent` directory against
      the `openbank_openbankingdb` database.
2. Contact us via [WSO2 Online Support System](https://support.wso2.com/support) to download the WSO2 Open Banking
   Migration Client Tool v1.0.0.
3. Copy the `wso2-openbanking-migration-1.0.0/openbanking-migration-resources` directory to `<IS_HOME>`.
4. Copy the `wso2-openbanking-migration-1.0.0/dropins/com.wso2.openbanking.migration-1.0.0.jar` file to `<IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins`.
5. Open the `wso2-openbanking-migration-1.0.0/openbanking-migration-resources/migration-config.yaml` file and
   set the `migrationEnable` property to `true`.
6. Start the Identity Server with the following command:
   
    ```
       sh wso2server.sh -DobMigrationSpec=BG
    ```
   
7. Stop the server.

    !!! warning
        If a failure occurred during the migration process, delete all the migrated data from the tables that 
        were generated during migration.

8. Remove the `<IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins/com.wso2.openbanking.migration-1.0.0.jar` file.
9. Remove the `<IS_HOME>/openbanking-migration-resources` directory.
10. Start the Identity Server and API Manager servers.
